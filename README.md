# hello-world
just poking around
But not for long! Soon I will have mastered this puny tutorial. And then, THE WORLD! 


## Quick update

- I'm now just using this nodescript repository as a home for various personal projects that I want to put up on github. 

- More specific projects will go in designated repositories. This is just for small one-off stuff that I'm goofing around with (eg. posting a markdown table of my expected picks for the Seattle Kraken expansion draft).
